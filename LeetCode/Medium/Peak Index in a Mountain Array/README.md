## Problem Description

<p>You are given an integer <strong>mountain</strong> array <code>arr</code> of length <code>n</code> where the values increase to a <strong>peak element</strong> and then decrease.</p>

<p>Return the index of the peak element.</p>

<p>Your task is to solve it in <code>O(log(n))</code> time complexity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">arr = [0,1,0]</span></p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">1</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">arr = [0,2,1,0]</span></p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">1</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">arr = [0,10,5,2]</span></p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">1</span></p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>arr</code> is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be a mountain array.</li>
</ul>

# Intuition
-  We have to find the element which is peak in the whole array.
- So we can see that this `[0,10,5,2]` array is first `increasing` in a sorted way then starts `decreasing` which is also in a sorted way.
- So by this we can see that we have to find the element which is the maximum and it\'s also present somewhere in the `middle` of the array {because first increasing then decreasing so it has to be somewhere in the middle}.
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

# Approach
- So by the intuation we can be clicked with a approach similer in which we have to find any value that is present in the middle somewhere, Yes! you are right `binary search`.
- By this we can find out where is the element which is more that out mid or less than our mid. That\'s the whole game.
- we start using normal binary search and let\'s think about the if else cases of our binary search.
- now if out `arr[mid]` is less than `arr[mid+1]` than we can understand that the array is `increasing right now` so our moutain element must be `somewhere ahead` then out current mid, So we update out `start= mid+1`.
- now if out `arr[mid]` is more than `arr[mid+1]` then its `deacresing right now` so out mountain element must be `somewhere behind` so we have to pull our `end = mid`.
- now we are ready with bothh condition so when we find the place where we can go no further `{s<e}` than we will return `start` position because starting point is the place which will be peak cause we are updating it when our mid is shorter.
- I hope you got the logic behind it.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log(n))
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)

        while(s<e){
            if(arr[mid] < arr[mid+1]){
                s = mid+1;
            }
            else{
